"""`.env.example` is the only documentation of what this thing needs to run.

Every variable Compose reads has a default, so a missing one never errors -- the
stack comes up and quietly does something other than what the operator intended.
`MIO_VLLM_GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION` is the sharp case: unset, the sidecar takes its
default fraction of a GPU shared with production through MPS, which does not
partition memory. Nothing fails. Production just gets slower.

The example file had drifted by six variables before this test existed, four of
them added the same week by overlays that nobody thought to document, because
nothing connected the two files.

Comments count. A commented-out line still tells the reader the variable exists
and what it is for, which is the whole job here; several of these should stay
commented, since setting them is the exception.
