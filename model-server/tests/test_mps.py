"""MPS is a property of the host, so it is detected rather than assumed.

A GPU in Exclusive Process mode can only be shared through an MPS daemon; a GPU
in the ordinary Default mode needs none of it. Both mistakes are silent:

* attach with no daemon behind the pipe directory and the client finds nothing
* skip it on an Exclusive Process GPU and the container never gets a context

This was originally wired into the base compose file with the pipe directory
written out as `/tmp/nvidia-mps-gpu1`, which was wrong twice over. It ignored
`GPU_DEVICE_IDS`, so selecting GPU 3 gave you GPU 3 with GPU 1's pipe -- a
mismatch nothing reports. And it applied on every host, including the laptops
and dedicated boxes where no daemon exists, which is what a teammate would hit
first.

Rendering is done by the real `docker compose config`, not by reading YAML, so
these check what Compose actually produces -- including whether an overlay's
`volumes` list quietly replaces the base service's mounts rather than adding to
them, which is the failure that would take the model's own source with it.
