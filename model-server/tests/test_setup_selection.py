"""setup.sh must offer the models, not assume them.

The requirement is that installing picks a model per slot from what is actually
in the repo. That regressed once already -- setup.sh asked "Enable STT? yes/no"
and then hardcoded `indic-conformer` -- so it is pinned here.

The menu is built by listing folders rather than parsing models.yaml, which
means adding a model folder makes it appear with no other edit. Everything below
checks the pieces that make that true.
