"""A model folder may bring services alongside its own container.

Indic-Mio is the first: token generation is a vLLM sidecar, because upstream
splits it that way and its Dockerfile pins a torch that vLLM's image would fight.
Rather than let that break the slot design, the folder declares the extra service
in `compose.extra.yml` and setup.sh picks the file up by existence.

What must stay true, and is easy to break silently:

* the slot still has exactly one service named after it, on its own port
* the sidecar publishes nothing on the host
* the overlay is actually applied when that model is selected
