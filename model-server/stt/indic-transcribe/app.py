#: Rotate a stream's decoder state on AUDIO DURATION, not token count.
#:
#: Duration is what actually governs both limits that matter. The audio buffer holds only
#: `left + chunk + right` = 11.44 s at the default geometry, so past that the oldest audio is
#: evicted while the decoder keeps accumulating token context for one ever-longer utterance --
#: cross-attention then pins to the window edge, AlignAtt's commit condition stops being
#: satisfied, and emission stalls until a pause lets attention drift back. That is the
#: "transcribed for ~19 s then stopped, resumed a little on each pause" report. Separately the
#: checkpoint trains at `max_duration: 30`, so one unbounded turn is outside its regime anyway.
#:
#: The earlier token-based trigger (300 tokens ~= minutes of speech) was far too late to help.
SAFE_ROLL_SECS = float(os.getenv("CORE_ROLL_SOFT_SECS", "12") or 12)

#: Silence long enough to be a word boundary, but far shorter than an endpoint decision.
ROLL_GAP_MS = 250.0
#: Secondary guard, unchanged in purpose: `pred_tokens_ids` is capped at `max_generation_length`
#: (512) and `decoder_mems_list` grows against the decoder's 1024-position limit. Overrunning
#: either is an out-of-bounds device write surfacing as a CUDA illegal memory access, so this
#: stays as a backstop even though duration should always trip first.
HARD_ROLL_TOKENS = 420
#: How much of the outgoing turn's text to carry into a seamless rotation. Must be large enough
#: to cover the audio window that is carried with it: the new decoder sees ~10.4 s of already
#: transcribed audio, and if the carried text covers less of it than the buffer does, the model
#: has audio it has no text for and tries to transcribe backwards. Measured at 24: turn-level
#: warm-up dropped to 0.37 s but the run lost 15% of its words. 0 disables the text carry.
CARRY_TOKENS = int(os.getenv("CORE_CARRY_TOKENS", "24") or 24)
#: Seconds of left context carried with it. 0 = the whole window.
CARRY_SECS = float(os.getenv("CORE_CARRY_SECS", "0") or 0)

#: Seamless rotation: hand the outgoing turn's audio window and text tail to the incoming one, so
#: it need not re-pay time-to-first-partial. OFF, because it was built, measured, and lost.
#:
#: The mechanism works -- a rotated turn committed in 0.37 s against 2.17 s cold -- but end to end
#: it is a regression every way it was configured, on the 43 s longform clip:
#:
#:   off (shipped)          95 commits  98% words  worst gap 2.39 s  tail 1.02 s
#:   on, full 10.4 s audio  58 commits  83% words  worst gap 6.50 s  tail 12.5 s
#:   on, 4 s audio          83 commits  97% words  worst gap 4.31 s  tail 1.07 s
#:   on, 2 s audio          52 commits  75% words  worst gap 3.74 s  tail 15.2 s
#:
#: Carried-token count made no difference at all (24/64/128 gave identical results), so the text
#: tail is not the lever -- the carried AUDIO is. A decoder handed a stretch it has already
#: transcribed stops producing rather than continuing, most plausibly predicting EOS on a context
#: that reads as a finished utterance. Kept behind this flag because it is measured and someone
#: will otherwise try it again.
