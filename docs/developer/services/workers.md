title: Workers and orchestrator
description: The ARQ worker and the campaign orchestrator.
---

Two containers run campaign work off the request path: `arq-worker` executes batches, and `campaign-orchestrator` decides when the next batch should run and when a campaign is finished. Neither serves HTTP. Both build from the same image as the [API](api).

This page is about the two processes — what they run, how they coordinate, and how to scale them. Campaign semantics — states, retries, scheduling windows, the circuit breaker — are in [Campaigns](../../guides/concepts/campaigns).

## Two containers, one image

`api`, `arq-worker`, and `campaign-orchestrator` are all `build: apps/api/Dockerfile`. They mount the same code and differ only in `command`:

| Container | Command | Entry point |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `api` | `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload` | `app/main.py` |
| `arq-worker` | `python -m arq app.tasks.arq.WorkerSettings` | `app/tasks/arq.py` |
| `campaign-orchestrator` | `python -m app.services.campaign.campaign_orchestrator` | `app/services/campaign/campaign_orchestrator.py` |

Their environment blocks differ too. The orchestrator gets the smallest set — FerretDB connection, `SECRET_KEY`, `REDIS_URL`, and `CAMPAIGN_BATCH_SIZE` — because it never touches MinIO or places a call itself. The worker additionally gets the MinIO variables, `INTERNAL_API_KEY`, `PROVIDER_AUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, and `VOICE_SERVER_BASE_URL`, because it dispatches real calls.

Redis is the only thing between them.

  API["api<br/>:8000"]
  ARQ["arq-worker"]
  ORCH["campaign-orchestrator"]
  R[("Redis")]

  API -- "enqueue_job()" --> R
  API -- "publish retry_needed" --> R
  ORCH -- "SUBSCRIBE campaign_events" --> R
  ORCH -- "enqueue process_campaign_batch" --> R
  R -- "ARQ queue" --> ARQ
  ARQ -- "publish batch_completed<br/>batch_failed" --> R
  R -- "campaign_events" --> ORCH
```

Neither worker calls the API over HTTP. Both import the same service layer and talk to FerretDB and Redis directly.

## The ARQ worker

`app/tasks/arq.py` defines `WorkerSettings`, with these verified values:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `functions` | `[sync_campaign_source, process_campaign_batch]` |
| `max_jobs` | `10` |
| `conn_timeout` | `10` |
| `redis_settings` | Host, port and password parsed from `REDIS_URL`; TLS enabled when the scheme is `rediss` |

`max_jobs = 10` is the concurrency ceiling for one worker process: at most ten jobs run at once. It is not the campaign batch size — that is `CAMPAIGN_BATCH_SIZE`, default `10`, from `app/config.py`.

The two registered functions live in `app/tasks/campaign_tasks.py`, and their names are pinned in the `FunctionNames` enum in `app/tasks/function_names.py` so producer and consumer cannot drift.

### `sync_campaign_source`

Loads the campaign, picks a sync service by `source_type` (default `csv`), and pulls the rows in.

* Zero rows synced → the campaign goes straight to `completed`, with `source_sync_status: "completed"`.
* Rows synced → state becomes `running` and a `sync_completed` event is published, which is what wakes the orchestrator.
* Any exception → state `failed`, `source_sync_status: "failed"`, `source_sync_error` set, a campaign log line appended, and the exception re-raised so ARQ records the failure.

### `process_campaign_batch`

Calls `campaign_call_dispatcher.process_batch(campaign_id, batch_size)` with `batch_size` defaulting to `settings.CAMPAIGN_BATCH_SIZE`, then publishes the outcome.

| Outcome | Published | Campaign state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Batch processed | `batch_completed` with `processed_count` | unchanged |
| `ConcurrentSlotAcquisitionError` | `batch_failed` | `failed` |
| `PhoneNumberPoolExhaustedError`, attempt 1 or 2 | `batch_completed` with `processed_count: 0` | unchanged |
| `PhoneNumberPoolExhaustedError`, attempt 3 | `batch_failed` | `failed` |
| Any other exception | `batch_failed` | `failed` |

The pool-exhausted path is a deliberate soft retry: `MAX_PHONE_POOL_ATTEMPTS = 3`, counted in the campaign document under `phone_number_pool_exhausted_attempts`. Publishing `batch_completed` with zero processed rows makes the orchestrator schedule another batch, giving numbers time to free up. A batch that processes anything resets the counter.

## The campaign orchestrator

`CampaignOrchestrator` is a long-lived asyncio process. `run()` starts two tasks and gathers them:

* `_listen_for_events()` subscribes to `CAMPAIGN_EVENTS_CHANNEL`, defined as `"campaign_events"` in `app/constants/campaign.py`.
* `_monitor_completion()` sweeps running campaigns on a timer.

Verified settings, all set in `__init__`:

| Setting | Value | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `completion_check_interval` | `60` seconds | How often the completion sweep runs |
| `completion_timeout` | `3600` seconds | Idle time before a campaign with no pending work is marked `completed` |
| Processing lock window | `5` seconds | Suppresses a duplicate `_schedule_next_batch` for the same campaign |
| Stale batch window | `300` seconds | An in-progress batch older than this is considered lost and rescheduled |

### Event handling

`_handle_event()` dispatches on the parsed event type from `campaign_event_protocol.py`:

| Event | What the orchestrator does |
| --- | --- |
| `batch_completed` | Clears `_batch_in_progress`, re-reads the campaign, and schedules the next batch if it is still `running`. |
| `batch_failed` | Clears `_batch_in_progress` and records activity. No new batch. |
| `sync_completed` | Schedules the first batch. |
| `retry_needed` | Applies `retry_config` and creates a new queued run with a `scheduled_for` in the future. |
| `circuit_breaker_tripped` | Clears all in-memory state for that campaign. |

`_schedule_next_batch()` re-reads the campaign, checks the state is `running` or `syncing`, checks the schedule window with `_is_within_schedule()`, checks the circuit breaker — pausing the campaign and publishing `circuit_breaker_tripped` if it is open — confirms there is pending or processing work, and only then enqueues `process_campaign_batch`.

### Retries

`_handle_retry_event()` reads `retry_config` from the campaign document and honours `enabled`, `retry_on_busy`, `retry_on_no_answer`, `retry_on_voicemail`, `max_retries`, and `retry_delay_seconds`. Defaults live in `DEFAULT_CAMPAIGN_RETRY_CONFIG` in `app/constants/campaign.py`: two retries, 120 seconds apart, retrying busy and no-answer but not voicemail. A run past `max_retries` increments `failed_rows` instead. Retry runs get a derived `source_uuid` of `{original}_retry_{n}` and a `parent_queued_run_id`.

### Completion detection

Every 60 seconds `_check_stale_campaigns()` walks campaigns in state `running`. For each one, it reschedules if a tracked batch has been in progress longer than 300 seconds, schedules a batch if there is pending work and no batch running, and otherwise tests `_should_mark_complete()`: no batch in progress, no pending or processing runs, and no activity for `completion_timeout`. When there is no in-memory activity timestamp it falls back to `last_activity_at`, `last_batch_scheduled_at`, or `started_at` on the document. Completion re-checks pending work once more before writing `state: "completed"` and publishing `campaign_completed`.

## Redis keys

Both processes share one Redis instance, addressed by `REDIS_URL`.

| Key or channel | Written by | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `campaign_events` (pub/sub channel) | API, ARQ worker, orchestrator | The campaign event bus. |
| ARQ's own queue and job keys | `enqueue_job()` in `app/tasks/arq.py` | Job queue, managed by the ARQ library. |
| `cb_failures:{campaign_id}`, `cb_successes:{campaign_id}` | `circuit_breaker.py` | Rolling success and failure counts per campaign. |
| `cb_recent_failures:{campaign_id}` | `circuit_breaker.py` | Recent failure detail for the tripped event. |
| `concurrent_calls:{organization_id}` | `call_concurrency/rate_limiter.py` | Live concurrency slots per organisation, 3600s TTL. |
| `concurrent_calls_fleet` | `call_concurrency/rate_limiter.py` | Fleet-wide slot set across organisations. |
| `rate_limit:{scope}` | `call_concurrency/rate_limiter.py` | Sliding-window rate limit, 2s TTL. |

Slot and rate-limit keys are manipulated by Lua scripts so acquisition is atomic across processes. See [Call concurrency and rate limiting](../reference/call-concurrency).

## Scaling

**The ARQ worker scales horizontally.** ARQ hands each queued job to exactly one worker, and `process_campaign_batch` acquires concurrency slots through the atomic Lua scripts in `rate_limiter.py`. Run as many replicas as your provider concurrency allows; `max_jobs = 10` multiplies per replica.

```bash
docker compose up -d --scale arq-worker=3
```

<Warning>
**Do not run more than one `campaign-orchestrator`.** The code does not make it safe.

The orchestrator keeps its scheduling state in three plain Python dictionaries on the instance — `_processing_locks`, `_last_activity`, and `_batch_in_progress`. None of it is in Redis, so a second replica shares nothing with the first. Both would receive every message on `campaign_events`, because pub/sub fans out to all subscribers rather than distributing, and both would call `_schedule_next_batch()` for the same `batch_completed`. The five-second `_processing_locks` guard is per process and would not stop the duplicate. The result is two `process_campaign_batch` jobs per completed batch, so a campaign dials at twice its configured rate.

The completion sweep has the same problem in reverse: `_batch_in_progress` is populated only by the replica that enqueued the batch, so the other replica sees no batch running and may mark a live campaign `completed`.

Run exactly one replica. Compose fixes it at one by giving the service a `container_name`, which prevents scaling it by accident.
</Warning>

Making it safe would take a Redis-backed lock in place of the in-memory dictionaries. That work has not been done.

## Failure and restart behaviour

Both containers carry `restart: unless-stopped`, and both gate on `ferretdb` starting and `redis` passing its healthcheck. The worker additionally waits for `api` to start.

| Process | On restart |
| --- | --- |
| `arq-worker` | Queued jobs survive in Redis and are picked up again. A job in flight when the process dies is retried by ARQ. Because a batch republishes its outcome on completion, the orchestrator sees the result either way. |
| `campaign-orchestrator` | All in-memory state is lost. Nothing is replayed: pub/sub does not persist, so events published while it was down are gone. Recovery comes from `_monitor_completion()` — within `completion_check_interval`, that is 60 seconds, the sweep finds every `running` campaign with pending work and schedules a batch for it. |

The orchestrator handles `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT`, sets `_running` to false, cancels its task, unsubscribes, and closes the Redis client — so `docker compose stop` is a clean shutdown, not a kill.

<Note>
The 60-second sweep is the only recovery path for events missed during an orchestrator restart. A campaign can therefore stall for up to a minute after the container comes back. If it stalls for longer, check the logs below before assuming the campaign is broken — see [Campaign troubleshooting](../../guides/troubleshooting/campaigns).
</Note>

## Logs to watch

```bash
docker compose logs -f arq-worker campaign-orchestrator
```

| Line | Source | Means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Campaign Orchestrator starting...` | orchestrator | The process is up and about to subscribe. |
| `Processing batch campaign=… size=…` | worker | A batch job started. |
| `Starting source sync for campaign …` | worker | CSV or other source ingest began. |
| `Error syncing campaign …` | worker | Sync failed; the campaign is now `failed`. |
| `Batch failed campaign=…` | worker | The batch raised; the campaign is now `failed`. |
| `Circuit breaker tripped campaign=… failure_rate=…` | orchestrator | Failure rate crossed the threshold; the campaign is `paused`. |
| `Published retry event call_id=… reason=…` | API or worker | A call outcome asked for a retry. |
| `Completion monitoring failed: …` | orchestrator | The sweep raised. It is caught and retried next interval, so this alone does not stop the process. |
| `Completion check campaign=…` | orchestrator | One campaign failed its completion check; the others still ran. |

A worker with no `Processing batch` lines while a campaign sits in `running` usually means the orchestrator is not enqueueing — check that its container is up and subscribed before looking at the worker.
