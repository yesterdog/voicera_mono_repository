title: Endpoints cheatsheet
description: Every VoicEra endpoint on one page, grouped by service.
---

Every HTTP and WebSocket route the VoicEra stack exposes, extracted from the routers. Use this to find a path fast; use `/docs` on a running API for the always-current schema, request bodies, and response models.

The API serves interactive OpenAPI docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs` and ReDoc at `/redoc`. Those are generated from the same routers this page was extracted from, so they never drift.

<Note>
This page is hand-maintained, not generated from a spec — this site has no static OpenAPI file wired into its build. That means it and the per-resource pages under [Endpoints](agents) can drift from the routers and from each other if one is updated without the other. When you add or change a route, update both this page and its resource page in the same change, and treat `/docs` on a running API as the tiebreaker if they ever disagree.
</Note>

## Auth column values

| Value | Dependency in the route signature | How you satisfy it |
|---|---|---|
| `public` | none | No header. |
| `Bearer` | `Depends(get_current_user)` | `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` from `POST /users/login`. |
| `X-API-Key` | `Depends(verify_api_key)` | `X-API-Key: <INTERNAL_API_KEY>` — service-to-service only. |
| `Bearer (admin)` | `Depends(get_current_user)` plus an in-body role check against `{super_admin, admin}` | Bearer token whose `role` claim is `admin` or `super_admin`. |
| `Bearer (super_admin)` | `Depends(get_current_user)` plus an in-body check against `super_admin` | Bearer token whose `role` claim is `super_admin`. |

The dependencies are defined in `apps/api/app/auth.py`. Role checks are not dependencies — they are explicit `HTTPException` raises inside the handler, so a wrong role returns `403`, not `401`.

## API — `:8000`

Every router below is mounted under `settings.API_V1_PREFIX`, which defaults to `/api/v1` (`apps/api/app/config.py`). The paths in this table already include that prefix. `GET /` and `GET /health` are declared directly on the app in `apps/api/app/main.py` and are **not** prefixed.

`POST /api/v1/calls/inbound` and `PATCH /api/v1/calls/*` take a Bearer token, not `X-API-Key`, even though the runtime is the usual caller. The runtime obtains that token from `POST /api/v1/users/bot/token`, which is the one route that trades the internal key for a JWT.

## Runtime — `:7860`

Three routes, all declared in `apps/runtime/routes/` and mounted with no prefix (`apps/runtime/app.py`). Nothing here is authenticated: the runtime trusts the network and the identifiers in the URL.

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/health` | public | Returns `{"status": "ok", "service": "voicera-runtime"}`. |
| GET, POST | `/answer` | public | Telephony answer webhook. Returns Stream XML pointing at the media WebSocket. Requires `agent_id` and `org_id` query parameters. |
| WS | `/agent/{org_id}/{agent_id}` | public | Media WebSocket for the Pipecat pipeline. Accepts an optional `call_id` query parameter for CallLog correlation. |

<Warning>
The runtime authenticates nothing. `/answer` and `/agent/{org_id}/{agent_id}` are reachable by anyone who can reach the port, and `/answer` is the route your telephony provider calls, so it must be publicly resolvable. Put it behind a reverse proxy and restrict by source where you can — see [Security hardening](../guides/deployment/security-hardening).
</Warning>

## Model-server gateway — `:8100`

Declared in `model-server/gateway/app/main.py`. The gateway is the only published port in the model-server stack; the STT, TTS, and LLM containers are reachable only by service name on the internal network. No route requires authentication.

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/health` | public | Probes each deployed slot. Returns `503` when a deployed slot is unreachable; an undeployed slot is not a fault. |
| GET | `/models` | public | Full catalogue from `models.yaml`, each entry flagged with whether it is deployed. |
| GET | `/v1/models` | public | OpenAI-compatible list of only the models callable right now. |
| GET | `/demo` | public | Live STT demo page, proxied from whichever model fills the STT slot. |
| GET | `/v1/languages` | public | Languages the STT checkpoint in the slot actually speaks. |
| POST | `/v1/audio/transcriptions` | public | OpenAI-compatible transcription, proxied to the STT slot. |
| WS | `/v1/asr/ws` | public | Streaming transcription relay to the STT slot. Not an OpenAI route. |
| WS | `/v1/realtime` | public | OpenAI Realtime transcription relay to the STT slot. |
| POST | `/v1/audio/speech` | public | OpenAI-compatible speech synthesis, proxied to the TTS slot. |
| POST | `/v1/chat/completions` | public | OpenAI-compatible chat, proxied to the LLM slot. |

A request to a slot with no model deployed returns `503` with `"type": "upstream_not_configured"`; a WebSocket route sends a JSON error frame and closes with code `1013`.

<Note>
`model-server/README.md` states that the LLM slot has never been built or started, so the vLLM flags behind `/v1/chat/completions` are unverified. Treat that route as untested.
